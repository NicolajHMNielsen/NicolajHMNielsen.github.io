> [Hawkes Processes](projects/cornell/slides_hawkess_processes.pdf) - a presentation on properties of Hawkes Processes and how they can be used to model micronoise structure. Kudos to Dean Markwick for an amazing and intuitive [blog](https://dm13450.github.io/2022/05/11/modelling-microstructure-noise-using-hawkes-processes.html) on the topic.

* [UBS Trading Insights: An Analysis of Daily and Intraday Trading Activities](projects/cornell/fin_stat_projects/ORIE5640_project_2.pdf) - an analysis during the UBS-CS merger to understand trading activities during the acquisition. We GARCH-type models on daily price dynamics and conduct analysis on 5-min intra day volumes.

* [Numerical Methods for Stochastic Differential Equations with Applications to Electricity Futures](projects/dtu_during_msc/numerical_methods_for_diff_eq/Numerical_Methods_for_Stochastic_Differential_Equations_and_Levy_Processes.pdf) - a comprehensive report were we develop a method to quantify the market risk premium in electricity markets and apply higher order stochastic Runge-Kutta methods to improve estimation of
parameters.

* [**Publication**: Grey-box modeling for hot-spot temperature prediction of oil-immersed transformers in power distribution networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352467723000565?via%3Dihub) - a publication were we developed a grey-box model to be used for online estimation and forecasting of the temperature inside a temperature. Publiched in *Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks*.



* [Mixed-Effects Models](projects/dtu_during_msc/02424/02424___Assignment_3.pdf) - a comprehensive report were we work with mixed-effects models.

* [Constrained Optimization](projects/dtu_during_msc/exam_constrained_optimization.pdf) - a comprehensive report on the topic of constrained optimization.

* [Modelling of Electricity Futures](projects/dtu_during_msc/Modelling_Electricity_Futures.pdf) - a comprehensive report on statistical modelling of electricity futures with focus on spreads.

* [Credit Value Adjustments](projects/dtu_during_msc/Assignment_2.pdf) - a small project on credit value adjustments.

* [Neural ODE](projects/dtu_during_bsc/neural_ode/report_neural_ode.pdf) - we followed ideas by Dr. Christopher Rackauckas now drafted into his [book](https://book.sciml.ai). During the project we also made two blog posts; one one [augmented neural ODEs](https://nicolajhmnielsen.github.io/SciML_DTU/ANODE/HTML/Augmented) and [another](https://nicolajhmnielsen.github.io/SciML_DTU/ANODE/HTML/Hidden_bears) were we explore dynamics in the augmented dimensions.

* [Hierarchical Deep Learning and Time Steppers](https://nicolajhmnielsen.github.io/SciML_DTU/HiTS_and_SINDy/HiTS/hierarchical_deep_learning_time_steppers) - an attempt to model slow-fast dynamics with hierarchical flow maps.



* [Exploration of the SINDy method and PySINDy package](https://nicolajhmnielsen.github.io/SciML_DTU/HiTS_and_SINDy/HiTS/Explore_SINDy) - theoretical foundation of SINDy and some exploration on how it works on three simulated dynamical systems
